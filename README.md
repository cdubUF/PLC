This course introduces students to the design and implementation of programming
languages. Specific topics include lexing/parsing, formal grammars, runtime
semantics, scoping, semantic analysis, and backend code generation. Additionally,
the course will explore variations in programming language design between
multiple languages to gain a better understanding of differences across languages
and the underlying concepts/problems they aim to solve.
